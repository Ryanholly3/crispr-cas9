            So you want to learn CRISPR-cas9, huh? Slow down there. Maybe we
            should learn the basics of cell biology and DNA first. Scroll down
            to learn the background on these topics, and then take a look at the
            CRISPR-cas9 section. You'll be an expert geneticist in no time!

          <h2>Wait, what is a cell?</h2>
          <p>
            A cell is the most basic unit of life! All living things are made up
            of cells - you, your dog, your favorite succulent, and even bacteria
            in your gut... ew. All animal cells have a basic layout, and share
            some basic components. One of the most important component of a cell,
            is the cell's nucleus. Inside the nucleus, the cell protects DNA -
            the instruction manual that tells the cell how to make all of its components! <br><br>
            DNA stores information inside of genes. Make sure you understand
            the difference between DNA and genes! DNA is composed of bases
            (sort of like letters) and forms a large string. A gene is a region
            of DNA that codes for a cellular component. About 1000 genes reside
            on a single DNA strand. Humans have about 25,000 genes! Genes vary
            between people. Almost All of the variation we see in humans, comes
            from differences at the level of genes! <br><br>Now that you understand what
            a gene is, let's move on to DNA editing.

          <h2>DNA editing</h2>
          <p>
            Ever since Gregor Mendel discovered genes in 1866, biologists have
            DREAMED of being able to manipulate genes. But in order to get there
            biologists needed to better understand DNA. Biologists eventually
            figured out how gene editing could theoretically be performed. First, DNA
            must be cut at the site to be edited. Next, template DNA must be
            provided that contains the edits. The reason why this works, is that having
            broken DNA is a life-or-death situation for a cell. The cell has a
            repair mechanism in place to fix broken DNA - it searches for DNA that resembles the
            DNA at the breaksite. If successful, it "grabs" that DNA, and copies
            off of it to bridge the DNA break. If the template is different from
            the original strand. An edit could be made! Despite understanding
            how this would work - Biologists struggled to accomplish the first
            step, cutting DNA at a specific place! <br><br>Now that you know the basics
            to of gene editing, move onto CRISPR-cas9! You're almost
            an expert!!

          <h2>Crispr-cas9</h2>
          <p>
            CRISPR-cas9 finally solved the problem and gave biologists a means
            to cut DNA at a specific place! While studying a bacterial defense
            system against invading viruses, Jennifer Doudna at UC Berkeley
            discovered CRISPR-cas9. She found that bacteria have a sort of immune
            system against viruses. When viruses attack bacteria, viruses inject their
            DNA into the bacterial cell. If the bacterial cell survive the attack, they
            save a copy of a piece of the viral DNA, and add into into their own DNA, in a
            CRISPR (an abbreviation for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
            Palindromic Repeats). If the bacterial cell comes in contact with
            that viral DNA again, the bacteria uses it to target
            the viral DNA for destruction! A bacterial protein, Cas9, binds to a copy of the CRISPR DNA,
            finds the match, and cuts it at a very precise site. This prevents the
            virus from being able to propagate. Biologists quickly realized that
            they could use cas9 in the lab to target any piece of DNA to be cut,
            as long as they could make a guide for cas9.<br><br> There you have it!
            You are officially a geneticist expert!
